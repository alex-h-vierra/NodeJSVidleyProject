The Node.JS vidley project is a project created to learn about Node.js, 
and how to use Node.js and libararies. The main library I used when creating this project 
is the node_module folder that can be reinstated using 
      <npm init
by no means is this project a high level project rather it is a teaching project that alowed me
to develope: 
      JavaScript syntax, 
      Node.js usage, 
      MongoDB, 
      OOP, 
      Authication usage, 
      Middleware functions, 
      Error handling,
      DB integration,
      UnitTest casing,
      Models
